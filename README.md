# Hyperledger Grid

Hyperledger Grid [has moved](https://github.com/hyperledger/toc/issues/82) to [End of life status](https://toc.hyperledger.org/governing-documents/project-lifecycle.html#end-of-life).

## grid-contrib

The grid-contrib repository contains contributed software for
[Hyperledger Grid](https://grid.hyperledger.org), a platform for building
supply chain solutions that include distributed ledger components.

This repository is intended for community-contributed software, including
example libraries, data models, and reference implementations for smart
contracts (also called "transaction families"). This software is designed to
work with the Hyperledger Grid platform software in the [grid
repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid).

For example, the Grid Track and Trace transaction family provides a smart
contract that tracks goods as they move through a supply chain. For more
information, see the [Grid Track and Trace
documentation](https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/grid/nightly/master/transaction_family_specifications/grid_track_and_trace_family_specification.html)
and the
[grid/track_and_trace](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/tree/master/track_and_trace)
subdirectory in this repository.


## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to this repository, either as changes to existing
software or as new example tools and reference implementations. Please follow
